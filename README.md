## AdventOfCode2024

# Challenge for this year, is to solve all the challenges in Go, but I will try to not use any external libraries. 
# Meaning I will have to implement my own data structures and algorithms and also basic data handling.
# Is this a smart move, because Advent of Code is a timed event? Probably not :D!
# But it seems fun and I will learn a lot!
